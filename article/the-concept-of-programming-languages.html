<p><em>Understanding the motivation and key idea behind programming languages</em></p>
<hr />
<p>This document aims to shed some light on the significance of programming languages and, at a high level, how code is actually executed by the CPU.</p>
<h2 id="instruction-sets">Instruction Sets</h2>
<p>At the the very core of your computer is the Central Processing Unit (CPU). This is basically the brain of your computer and does all of the information processing. I think most people are already aware of the integral role that the CPU plays in a computer but this document intends to go deeper. How does the CPU actually do what it does? Of course, the answer provided here is just a <strong>very</strong> high level overview- there are entire books written on this topic.</p>
<p>In essence, <strong>a CPU is a machine which offers functionality through a particular set of instructions</strong>. Needless to say, this set of instructions is robust enough to make possible all the computing that we observe today. The instructions can be grouped into three major categories: data movement, arithmentic/logic and control flow (order of execution of instructions).</p>
<p>A program is a <strong>list of instructions to be executed by the CPU sequentially</strong>. In the early days of computing, computer scientists used to write programs using the CPU instruction set itself. This was programming in <em>assembly language</em>. But as you can imagine, there are many challenges associated with this. A few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs written for a particular CPU may not run on another CPU which implements a different instruction set</li>
<li>The developer needs to have intricate knowledge of the CPU instruction set and implementation to be any good</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where programming languages come in...</p>
<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Programming languages provide a higher level of abstraction over the CPU instruction set. The higher this level of abstraction, the higher the level of the programming language. For example, C and Python are both programming languages, but they differ in the level of abstraction that they provide over the CPU instruction set. C provides abstractions/constructs which are much closer to the CPU's instruction set than Python's. As such, one may say that C is, relative to Python, a low level programming langugage. But relative to assembly/machine code, both C and Pyhton are regarded to be higher level programming langugages.</p>
<p>Programming langugages provide solutions to the problems above. From this point onwards, I shall use C for examples most of the time as it's neither too high level nor loo low level. The C compiler is a special program which enables one to generate low level machine dependent code from machine independent C code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages can be implemented differently on different CPUs. For example, the C compiler is implemented differently for an Intel i5 processor, compared to an i7 processor because the instruction sets for these CPUs differ.</li>
<li>The developer no longer needs to care about the CPU on which the code is to be executed. The implementation of the programming langugage (in the case of C, the C compiler) for that particular machine (architecture) will take care of that!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see this in action! Suppose one wants to write a program to print the text "Hello World!" onto the screen (I know this is kind of a cliché, but its a simple enough demonstration). Here is the C source code which would accomplish this task, stored in a file called <code>hello.c</code>:</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>
<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)</span> {
    <span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!\n"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>In order to see the equivalent assembly code (on my Dual-Core Intel Core i5 processor), we can use the C compiler to compile it into assembly (<code>$</code> denotes a command line, <code>gcc</code> is a C compiler program):</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code>$ gcc -S hello.c</code></pre></div>
<p>This command instructs the program <code>gcc</code> to compile the C source code in the file <code>hello.c</code> into the corresponding assembly code. By default, this will output the assembly code in to a file called <code>hello.s</code> (or <code>.asm</code>). If we take a look at the contents of <code>hello.s</code>, here's an example of what one would see:</p>
<div><pre class="hljs"><code>    .section	__TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions
    .build_version macos, <span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-number">15</span>	sdk_version <span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-number">15</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>
    .globl	_main                   <span class="hljs-comment">## -- Begin function main</span>
    .p2align	<span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0x90</span>
_main:                                  <span class="hljs-comment">## @main</span>
    .cfi_startproc
<span class="hljs-comment">## %bb.0:</span>
    pushq	%rbp
    .cfi_def_cfa_offset <span class="hljs-number">16</span>
    .cfi_offset %rbp, -<span class="hljs-number">16</span>
    movq	%rsp, %rbp
    .cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp
    subq	$16, %rsp
    leaq	L<span class="hljs-number">_</span>.str(%rip), %rdi
    movb	$0, %al
    callq	_printf
    xorl	%ecx, %ecx
    movl	%eax, -<span class="hljs-number">4</span>(%rbp)          <span class="hljs-comment">## 4-byte Spill</span>
    movl	%ecx, %eax
    addq	$16, %rsp
    popq	%rbp
    retq
    .cfi_endproc
                                        <span class="hljs-comment">## -- End function</span>
    .section	__TEXT,__cstring,cstring_literals
L<span class="hljs-number">_</span>.str:                                 <span class="hljs-comment">## @.str</span>
    .asciz	<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!\n"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Clearly, the assembly code is more intricate and requires a deeper understanding of CPU registers and instructions in order to write- but a developer need not understand this when writing his/her source code in C. From this example, it should be evident what "high level" means in the context of programming langugages: with just 4 lines of C code, a developer can achieve what would take over 20 lines of assembly code. Also, the generated assembly code is dependent on the architecture of the machine, but the C code which produces the assembly code is NOT: the CPU has been completely abstracted away by the programming language!</p>
