<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>
<p>Today I got called by <code>647</code> number, with a Thomas Hill on the line, who had a Russian/European accent. He claimed that he works for <code>blockchain.com</code> and is involved in account recovery, which is why I'm supposed to believe that the domain <code>recoveringblockchain.com</code> is legitimate.<br />
I previously had a coinbase account, and I thought that there could be a chance that this was still legitimate, so I proceeded with extreme caution. "Thomas" asked me if I can share my screen so he can "explain" to me what wallet I was going to recover, and show me how to recover it. I knew that screen sharing is not really a way for someone to access my information or gain control of my system, and I was not going to open my bank account while screen sharing, so I accepted and he emailed me a zoom link. I joined the meeting from a private browser window, and shared only the private browsing window.<br />
Next, he sent a link to a transaction on <code>blockchain.com</code>. The wallet had a balance of around $50K USD, and I immediately thought that there's no way that this is legitimate. I figured that I would have to pay "account recovery fees" before the funds could be accessed, and the scammers would ghost me after receiving the payment.<br />
Anyways, I insisted on them being straight forward and telling me the next steps. He told me that next they would transfer the funds to a crypto account I own (they have to verify this). I was of course very skeptical, and to be honest I was being very closed off, so he said he'd send me an email and I can verify that it's legitimate.<br />
Well after receiving the email, from the <code>@recoveringblockchain.com</code> domain, I knew that this was definitely a scam. I looked up the <code>blockchain.com</code> support page, and it clearly said that they don't call you, and they only send emails from the <code>blockchain.com</code> apex domain - I knew then that I was being targeted by scammers.</p>

<p>Now that I knew who I was up against was malicious, I wanted to introduce roadblocks for them, and at the very least I did the following.</p>
<ul>
<li class="md-checkbox joplin-checkbox"><div class="checkbox-wrapper"><input type="checkbox" id="md-checkbox-15" checked="checked" /><label id="cb-label-md-checkbox-15" for="md-checkbox-15" class="checkbox-label-checked">Register complaints with the authorities.</label></div>
