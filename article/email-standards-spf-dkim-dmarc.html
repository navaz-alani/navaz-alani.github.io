<p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is an authentication policy that uses two other policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) provides authorization
<ul>
<li>Identifies which mail servers can send mail on behalf of the custom <code>MAIL FROM</code> domain configured in DNS.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>MAIL FROM</code> is also called the <code>RETURN PATH</code>, <code>ENVELOPE FROM</code>, <code>BOUNCE ADDRESS</code> and is an email address.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recipient mail servers will check the SPF to ensure that the sending server is allowed to send mail for the <code>MAIL FROM</code> domain</li>
<li>Designed to prevent spoofing, but not 100% reliable, so also need to use DKIM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) provides authentication
<ul>
<li>Adds a digital signature to the messages, in a header</li>
<li>The recipient servers can then confirm that the signature matches a key that the domain owns (public key in the DNS)</li>
<li>Since the signature is in a header, DKIM works when a mail server chooses to forward email unchanged (which would fail under SPF)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both SPF and DKIM verify things that ther user cannot see, namely that the <code>MAIL FROM</code> aligns with the sending server's IP (SPF) and that the message is signed properly by the <code>MAIL FROM</code> domain. In particular, there is no checks done against the address that the user's see, the <code>FROM</code> address. DMARC fixes this:</p>
<ol>
<li>There must be alignment on at least 1 of the classic SPF/DKIM checks on the <code>MAIL FROM</code> address.</li>
<li>For further SPF alignment (if previously aligned), DMARC requires that the <code>FROM</code> address and the <code>MAIL FROM</code> address have the same domain.</li>
<li>For further DKIM alignment (if previously aligned), DMARC requires that the domain specificed in the DKIM signature matches the one in the <code>FROM</code> address.</li>
</ol>
